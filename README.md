# Movie Finder Application using OMDB API and React Hooks

This is an quick react application demonstrating how react-hooks works. I have used create-react-app to bootstrap this porject along with OMDB API.

## OMDB API

OMDb (The Open Movie Database)  is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users.
